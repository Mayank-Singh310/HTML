           <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING
              </h1>
<p>The term problem solving is used in many disciplines ,some times with diffren prespectives and often with different terminologies.forinstance A computer is a very powerful and versatile machine capable of performing
a multitude of different tasks, yet it has no intelligence or thinking power. The
intelligence Quotient (I.Q) of a computer is zero.<b> A computer performs many
tasks exactly in the same manner</b> as it is told to do. This places responsibility on
the user to instruct the computer in a correct and precise manner, so that the
machine is able to perform the required job in a proper way. A wrong or
ambiguous instruction may sometimes prove disastrous

<ol><i>Procedure (Steps Involved in Problem Solving)</i>
<li>Understanding the problem</li>
 <li>Analyzing the problem</li>
<li> Developing the solution</li>
<li> Coding and implementation.</li>

</ol>

<ul><strong>Steps involved in algorithm development</strong>

<li>Identification of input</li>
<li>Identification of output</li>
<li>Identification the processing operations </li>
<li>Processing Definiteness </li>

<dl>
        <dt>Finiteness:<dd>An algorithm must terminate in a finite number of steps</dd>
           </dt>
       <dt>Definiteness<dd>Each step of the algorithm must be precisely and
unambiguously stated</dd>
         </dt>
           <dt>Effectiveness<dd>
		   Each step must be effective, in the sense that it should
be primitive easily convert able into program statement) can be performed exactly
in a finite amount of time.

<ol>
<li>Features of C language
</li>
<ul>
Simple, versatile, general purpose language
 <li>It has rich set of Operators</li>
 <li>Program execution are fast and efficient<li>
 <li>Can easily manipulates with bits, bytes and addresses
 Varieties of data types are available</li>
 <li>Separate compilation of functions is possible and such functions can be
called by any C program</li>
</ul>
<li>Block- structured language
 Can be applied in System programming areas like operating systems,</li>
<li>compilers & Interpreters, Assembles, Text Editors, Print Spoolers, Network
Drivers, Modern Programs, Data Bases, Language Interpreters, Utilities etc</li>
